If you're working with **Skia** and want to combine it with other libraries to expand its capabilities, here are some libraries and frameworks that complement **Skia** for different purposes, such as UI development, event handling, or advanced rendering.

---

### **1. SkiaSharp**
- **Purpose**: .NET bindings for Skia.
- **Description**: If youâ€™re working in a .NET or C# environment, SkiaSharp allows you to use Skia easily in projects like Xamarin, .NET MAUI, or WPF.
- **Use Case**: Build cross-platform applications or integrate Skia in .NET apps.
- **Link**: [SkiaSharp GitHub](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp)

### **2. SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer)**
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform multimedia and input handling library.
- **Description**: SDL2 can be used to create a rendering context for Skia and handle input events (mouse, keyboard, etc.).
- **Use Case**: Combine Skia's rendering with SDL2's event handling for games or graphical applications.
- **Link**: [SDL2 Website](https://www.libsdl.org/)

---

### **3. GLFW**
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform OpenGL and window creation library.
- **Description**: Like SDL2, GLFW provides a lightweight way to create windows and handle input. You can use Skia with an OpenGL backend and GLFW for windowing.
- **Use Case**: Combine Skia's OpenGL backend with GLFW for rendering in a desktop app.
- **Link**: [GLFW Website](https://www.glfw.org/)

---

### **4. Dear ImGui**
- **Purpose**: Immediate Mode UI library.
- **Description**: Dear ImGui can work as a UI layer on top of a Skia-powered renderer.
- **Use Case**: If you need lightweight UI controls (e.g., buttons, sliders) in your Skia application, integrate Dear ImGui.
- **Link**: [Dear ImGui GitHub](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

---

### **5. Freetype**
- **Purpose**: Font rendering library.
- **Description**: Although Skia has its own text rendering capabilities, you can integrate Freetype for advanced text shaping or glyph handling.
- **Use Case**: Use Freetype with Skia if you need full control over font rendering or additional features like subpixel positioning.
- **Link**: [Freetype Website](https://freetype.org/)

---

### **6. Cairo**
- **Purpose**: 2D graphics library.
- **Description**: Cairo is similar to Skia in scope but has different strengths. You could integrate Cairo with Skia for additional drawing capabilities or compatibility.
- **Use Case**: Use Cairo as a complementary or fallback rendering solution.
- **Link**: [Cairo Graphics](https://www.cairographics.org/)

---

### **7. NanoVG**
- **Purpose**: Vector graphics library.
- **Description**: NanoVG is a small library for vector-based rendering, often used for UIs in games. It can complement Skia for certain graphics needs.
- **Use Case**: Add lightweight vector graphics to a Skia-based application.
- **Link**: [NanoVG GitHub](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg)

---

### **8. Vulkan SDK**
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform graphics API.
- **Description**: Skia supports Vulkan as a backend for rendering. The Vulkan SDK provides tools, libraries, and examples to get started.
- **Use Case**: Combine Vulkan's high-performance rendering with Skia's 2D graphics.
- **Link**: [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)

---

### **9. OpenGL/GLEW/GLAD**
- **Purpose**: OpenGL context creation and management libraries.
- **Description**: Use OpenGL as the rendering backend for Skia. Libraries like **GLEW** or **GLAD** simplify working with OpenGL extensions.
- **Use Case**: Combine Skia's OpenGL backend with these libraries for cross-platform rendering.
- **Link**:
  - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
  - [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)

---

### **10. Qt**
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform UI framework.
- **Description**: You can integrate Skia with Qt for custom rendering within Qt widgets or applications.
- **Use Case**: Combine Skia's graphics capabilities with Qt's UI framework.
- **Link**: [Qt Website](https://www.qt.io/)

---

### **11. Emscripten**
- **Purpose**: Compile C++ code to WebAssembly.
- **Description**: If you're using Skia for web applications, Emscripten can compile your Skia-based code for the browser.
- **Use Case**: Deploy Skia applications to the web.
- **Link**: [Emscripten Website](https://emscripten.org/)

---

### **12. wxWidgets**
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform UI library.
- **Description**: Like Qt, wxWidgets can be combined with Skia for custom 2D graphics rendering in desktop applications.
- **Use Case**: Integrate Skia for advanced drawing within a wxWidgets app.
- **Link**: [wxWidgets Website](https://www.wxwidgets.org/)

---

### **13. imgui_sdl**
- **Purpose**: ImGui + SDL2 integration.
- **Description**: This library provides an easy way to combine Dear ImGui with SDL2. You can add Skia as the rendering backend.
- **Link**: [imgui_sdl GitHub](https://github.com/Tyyppi77/imgui_sdl)

---

### **14. Blend2D**
- **Purpose**: 2D rendering engine.
- **Description**: Blend2D is another high-performance 2D rendering library. You can use it alongside Skia for specific tasks.
- **Use Case**: Add additional rendering capabilities.
- **Link**: [Blend2D GitHub](https://github.com/blend2d/blend2d)

---

## **How to Choose?**
- **Rendering Backend**: Use Vulkan, OpenGL, or Direct3D depending on your performance and compatibility needs.
- **UI Development**: Choose Dear ImGui or a full-fledged framework like Qt or Avalonia.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: SDL2, GLFW, or wxWidgets are excellent options for windowing and input handling.
- **Web Development**: Use Emscripten for WebAssembly output.
